# Ricardo Zambon  
Senior Full-Stack Engineer (.NET, Angular, React, Azure DevOps) | Technical Lead

Senior Full-Stack Engineer and Technical Lead with 16+ years of experience designing, building, and delivering enterprise-grade software. My background spans high-scale backend systems in .NET, modern front-end architectures in Angular and React, and CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps.

I have worked extensively in fully English-speaking, cross-functional environments, contributing to projects where engineering decisions directly impacted business operations. My focus is on building reliable, maintainable, and scalable systems through clean architecture, strong typing, and disciplined engineering practices.

I actively invest in technical education, documentation, and knowledge sharing, with an emphasis on clarity, consistency, and long-term maintainability.
