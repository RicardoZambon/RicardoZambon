# Ricardo Zambon  
Senior Full-Stack Engineer (.NET, Angular, Azure DevOps) | Technical Lead

I am a Senior Full-Stack Engineer and Technical Lead with over sixteen years of experience designing, building, and delivering enterprise-grade applications. My work spans high-scale backend systems in .NET, modern front-end architectures in Angular and TypeScript, and continuous delivery pipelines in Azure DevOps.

Throughout my career, I have led engineering teams, established coding standards, improved software quality through code reviews and testing practices, and delivered mission-critical features for U.S. and international clients. I focus on building reliable, maintainable, and scalable solutions through clean architecture, strong typing, and well-structured development processes.

My professional experience includes fully English-speaking environments, cross-functional collaboration, and participation in projects where engineering decisions directly impact business operations. I continuously invest in technical education, writing, and knowledge sharing.
